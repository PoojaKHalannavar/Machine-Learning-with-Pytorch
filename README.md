# Machine-Learning-with-Pytorch

### Project Description:

This project focuses on Image Classification for **Handwritten Digit Recognition**. A Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) is implemented using PyTorch, utilizing the DataLoader for efficient data handling. The model consists of two hidden layers with ReLU activation, trained using CrossEntropyLoss and optimized with Adam optimizer.

### Dataset:

The MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 training and 10,000 testing grayscale images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (0-9), is used for training and evaluation

### Results:

With 5 epochs, it achieves an accuracy of 97.7% and an average loss of 0.089059, demonstrating strong performance.
